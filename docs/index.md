## Experience 

### Moogsoft (2018-Present)

* Currently the lead writer for Moogsoft's flagship product.  Wrote entire v1 doc set from scratch for Moogsoft Observability Cloud, which uses advanced AI-based algorithms to monitor, observe, filter, deduplicate, and correlate raw monitoring data into a single, interactive list of actionable incidents. This doc set is now the centerpiece of https://docs.moogsoft.com.

* Named an [Employee of the Quarter](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6800049491429990400/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A6800049491429990400%2C6801192805843791872)) for my revamp of the [Moogsoft API docs](https://api.docs.moogsoft.com/reference/overview). 

* Update Java codebase to update and improve auto-generated Swagger specs. Test and review API specs for clarity, consistency, and usability.  Writing guided "hello-world" code samples to onboard users to specific APIs (in progress). 

* Manage the git repos and publishing processes for Tech Content group. Developed a fully-automated, end-to-end pipeline for publishing and updating docs using Python, bash, and REST calls. 

* Evaluated Jekyll as a possible publishing platforms. Forked and modified a Jekyll doc theme and added Swagger UI functionality. Created a semi-automated pipeline to convert Moogsoft docs to markdown. 

* Evaluated Oxygen XML as a possible authoring tool. Created an XML repo that illustrates how to perform various tasks using DITA and Oxygen: define global variables, apply conditions to show/hide content, and publish output to HTML and PDF.
