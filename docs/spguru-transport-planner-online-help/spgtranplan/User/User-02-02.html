Product Features
</h2>

 


<a name="wp38446"> </a><p class="pBody">
Key features of SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner include:
</p>
<div class="pSmartList1"><ul class="pSmartList1">
<a name="wp85660"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Layered network models&#8212;SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner creates four-layered network models compliant with ITU and ANSI recommendations. This enables you to create an explicit network model at four different layers: physical (buildings and cables), multiplexing (equipped fibers), optical-wavelength channeling and routing, and digital client (SONET/SDH traffic and routing).</li></div>
<a name="wp85664"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Optical network architectures&#8212;SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner includes two different modes for modeling different architectures: </li></div>
<div class="pSmartList2"><ul class="pSmartList2">
<a name="wp44241"> </a><div class="pSmartList2"><li><em class="cEmphasis">Opaque</em> mode, for optical networks in which the OXC is surrounded by long-reach transponders interconnected to the WDM line systems. In these configurations, regeneration occurs at every intermediate node.</li></div>
<a name="wp44243"> </a><div class="pSmartList2"><li><em class="cEmphasis">Transparent</em> mode, for optical networks with a transparent OXC. Wavelengths that transit through the node can either pass transparently through the OXC, or they can be regenerated (using regeneration equipment connected to the OXC) to overcome transmission limitations.</li></div>
</ul></div>
<a name="wp43644"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Node models&#8212;With SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner, you can design a heterogeneous network with different node models (such as OXCs, DXCs, IXCs, and OADMs) assigned to the different nodes of your network</li></div>
<a name="wp88040"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Equipment models&#8212;SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner enables you to create generic equipment models for different types of WDM line systems and node equipment at the different layers. You can apply different cost models to line systems or node equipment so that the optimization algorithms select the most appropriate network equipment.</li></div>
<a name="wp39840"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Hardware configurator&#8212;In addition to using generic equipment models, you can also do a post-design step using the Hardware Configurator (HCON). This step enables you to create detailed models of hardware from different vendors and to configure the equipment down to the rack, card, and port level.</li></div>
<a name="wp88083"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Topology Design&#8212;SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner&#39;s graphical user interface enables you to create and modify network designs easily. You can create new designs from scratch using a simple drag-and-drop interface. To modify your topology at different layers, you can introduce nodes of different types, define cables between nodes, introduce cable splitters, define fiber routes, and equip fibers with WDM line systems or SONET/SDH systems.</li></div>
<a name="wp88110"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Traffic Modeling&#8212;You can create different traffic matrices&#8212;which are groups of connections&#8212;at both the optical layer (wavelength services) and the electric layer (SONET/SDH services). You can define SONET/SDH services at the higher-order path layer (also called the <em class="cEmphasis">digital client</em> or <em class="cEmphasis">DCL</em> layer) and at the lower-order path (LOP) layer. You can create traffic matrices that group connections with common characteristics (such as service class, bit rate, and protection strategy). Thus you can create different matrices for different types of connections and use these matrices to model different types of traffic. You can also use the traffic matrices to model traffic for different time frames and do a multi-stage design of your network.</li></div>
<a name="wp102802"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Resource and Service Tracking&#8212;You can track services and resources in your network by assigning them a custom user designation. You can also assign specific service identifiers to traffic and resources to reserve specific resources for specific services only.</li></div>
<a name="wp89880"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Import/Export&#8212;You can import all relevant network data from ASCII files that describe your network topology, traffic, equipment, etc. This enables you to create network designs quickly from existing data. You can also export information to reuse the data in future projects.</li></div>
<a name="wp45767"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Multiple scenarios per project&#8212;Each project can contain multiple scenarios. Each scenario contains a network that is independent of the other scenarios in the project. You can extract and compare network statistics (such as network cost and capacity) across multiple scenarios.</li></div>
<a name="wp88278"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Routing&#8212;SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner can route traffic at both the optical-channel and the digital-client layers. You can apply both unprotected and diverse-path protected routing algorithms. The routing algorithms consider the capacity limitations of the installed equipment in the network. You can define a set of routing constraints for specific traffic, which SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner will consider during the route calculations.</li></div>
<a name="wp88279"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Manual routing&#8212;In addition to routing an entire traffic matrix, you can also establish connections individually. You can inspect the candidate routes and metrics and then select the route to use for a specific connection.</li></div>
<a name="wp88333"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Network dimensioning&#8212;Given a traffic matrix, SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner dimensions the nodes and links to accommodate the specified traffic. Custom algorithms dimension the network to maximize throughput at the lowest possible cost.</li></div>
<a name="wp88429"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Physical link design&#8212;SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;PlannerSP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner designs the links (that is, it places amplification and regeneration sites along a link) based on the transmission characteristics of the different WDM line system types. This enables the dimensioning and other design algorithms to consider the cost of amplifiers and regenerators in their calculations. </li></div>
<a name="wp92521"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Protection and restoration&#8212;SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner can consider various protection mechanisms at the optical and electrical layers: dedicated path (1+1), shared path (N:M), end-to-end path restoration, and link-based restoration. You can design your network to reserve sufficient spare capacity for the resilience strategy of your choice. SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner can calculate the protection paths using the shared risk link group (SRLG) concept to protect against failures of shared resources at lower network layers.</li></div>
<a name="wp88334"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Transparent networks&#8212;With SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner, you can design and evaluate networks that have limited transparency reach and selective regeneration. This enables you to balance the amount of required regeneration and the maximum length of a transparent connection in your network.</li></div>
<a name="wp88335"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Grooming&#8212;SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner supports multi-layer design actions that efficiently groom lower-bit-rate services into higher-bit-rate services. You can use LOP-to-DCL traffic grooming to translate VT-level SONET connections (or VC-level SDH connections) into STS-level signals (or STM-level SDH signals). You can use DCL-to-OCH traffic grooming to map SONET (or SDH) traffic into wavelengths in a cost-efficient way; this operation balances the routing and switching cost optimally over the optical and electrical layers.</li></div>
<a name="wp45768"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>SONET ring design&#8212;SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner supports SONET/SDH ring architectures. As part of the Digital Client Layer (DCL) infrastructure, you can specify SONET rings on top of the physical topology. You can route DCL traffic on these rings, upgrade the rings by adding stacked rings on top of them, or let the ring design operation determine the stacked rings to deploy.</li></div>
<a name="wp43698"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Availability calculations&#8212;Based on the failure rates specified for different network elements, and the recovery mechanism applied to a service, SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner can calculate the availability of service and calculate metrics such as expected loss of traffic.</li></div>
<a name="wp66606"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Failure analysis&#8212;You can also define your own failure scenarios within SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner. First you select the network elements that fail (such as cable cuts or OXC failures). Then SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner evaluates how these failures affect the traffic routed in the network and determines which connections are affected, lost, and recovered.</li></div>
<a name="wp66586"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Browsers&#8212;Browsers provide intuitive access to relevant node, link, and connection information at different layers. The tree structure allows you to expand or collapse branches to show or hide detail.</li></div>
<a name="wp38453"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Bill of Materials (BOM)&#8212;You can easily generate and view a comprehensive Bill of Materials that reports the line and node equipment at different areas in the network: tributary cards per bit rate, digital and optical cross-connects (DXCs and OXCs), OADMs, long- and short-reach transponders, in-line Optical Amplifiers (OAs), and regenerator equipment.</li></div>
<a name="wp88192"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Spreadsheet reports&#8212;You can export a wide variety of network data to comma separated value (CSV) files that can be opened and modified using a spreadsheet program such as Excel. These reports contain detailed information about node and link resources, connection routes, cost information, and so on.</li></div>
<a name="wp88220"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>Batch console&#8212;You can use SP&#160;Guru&#160;Transport&#160;Planner&#39;s batch console to open scenarios and run network design operations automatically. The batch console supports all network design operations that appear in the user interface. This enables you to perform complex and lengthy network designs during an overnight run.</li></div>
