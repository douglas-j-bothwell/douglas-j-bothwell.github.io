<!--
 Sometimes, a word may include punctuation or other characters such that
 users might not find the word during a normal search.  Synonyms allow
 help authors to associate a word with other possible spellings or
 formats such that searching for these alternate words will return the
 same result as searching for the first word.

 For example:

  <WebWorksSynonyms>
   <Word value="green">
    <Synonym value="greenery" />
    <Synonym value="grass" />
   </Word>
  </WebWorksSynonyms>

 Searching for "greenery" or "grass" will return same results that searching
 for "green" would return, even though "greenery" and "grass" may not exist
 in the generated output.
