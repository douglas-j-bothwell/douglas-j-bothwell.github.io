This attribute is optional.

  The following CommonWordsToSkip block allows you to define what
  words will be omitted from the generated full text search index.
  We have provided a list of low information words that are common
  in English as a starting point.  However, if you are processing
  documents in a different language, you will need to adjust the
  words accordingly.

  The "minlen" attribute specifies the minimum length of word to
  include in the full text search index.  Words that are fewer
  characters in length than this value will automatically be
  omitted from the search database, and need not be explicitly
  listed inside this block.  The default value of 3 seems to work
  well for English.  A value of 1 may be needed for CJK languages
  where one character can represent a whole word or concept.

  <!--
  The ScoringPrefs block allows you to control how search terms
  are scored by assigning different relative weights based on
  where a word occurs inside each document.  Three common
  META tags are supported by default, but this may be extended
  to custom META tags as follows (for a tag called partnum):

    <meta name="partnum" weight="100">

  For information on setting/creating META tags from within
  WebWorks Publisher, please see the online documentation.

  Note, that words occurring in elements not explicitly declared
  below will by default be scored with a weight of one.

  The TopicMap block is used for enabling context-sensitive help for
  use with your own software application. Publisher will automatically
  create Topic entries derived from the usage of the "TopicAlias"
  marker in your FrameMaker document(s). The "TopicAlias" marker should
  only contain the name of the topic.
  Each resulting Topic entry will be of the form:

    <Topic name="yourTopicName" href="yourBook/filename#123456">

  Where the topic name must contain only the characters:
  "A-Z", "a-z", "0-9", or "_".
